# Heart Disease Prediction Using Classification ❤️🩺

This project focuses on predicting heart disease using machine learning classification techniques.
The goal is to analyze patient health data and classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease or not.

The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook and follows a complete machine learning workflow.
